# User Authentication Angular Demo

This repo is from a course on building multiple pages in Angular.  This project
was based around creating my own User Authentication system with NodeJS and
Angular.  I used Sails for the basic template and worked from there to create a
User model to work with.

I worked with creating all of my routes for the backend NodeJS server along with
the user Registration and Login code so that user's can interface with the app
easily.  This covered creating new users and using the machinepack addon to
encrypt our passwords so that login and logouts can be handled securely.
